# stock_analysis Module 2 Challenge

VBA Module Challenge

Created an inital loop to return tickers, yearly change, percentage of change, and total stock volume for each worksheet.
Then I created two additional loops to capture the greatest increase, decrease, and volume of stocks for each worksheet.

I used vba conditional formatting to apply green, red, and yellow to the "Yearly Change" column.
    Green is a positive change
    Yellow is no change or 0
    Red is a negative change

I used .NumberFormat to properly format % and $ for appropriate columns.
